<b>EMilY's Music Shack</b>

Simple (though not THAT simple) app showcasing React, Flux, Boostrap, HTML5, CSS3 and some Node.js middleware server (for downloading and scanning HTML code for links) working together.
Not super - polished yet, but usable and pretty quick.

May the (dark) force be with you!
